<h1>Upgrade Summary</h1>
Hictop 3dp-11 mainboard upgraded to SKR 1.4 with latest version of Marlin, 2.1.2

<h1>Flip display cable</h1>
<p>
  Display did not work after flashing firmware. Switching positions did not fix it. Removing the wire from the connector, flipping upside down, and re-punching did the trick. I did this on the display side.
